# Terminal Adventure - Candlelight

A very short RPG inside the terminal, built with python as a Codedex project challenge. 
The scope was to use variables, control flow statements, and loops, which I have gone through during the first part or the course. 

## Features

- Short, engaging narration
- Choices
- Enemy variation
- Retries
- Easy-to-use interface
- Runs as a standalone Windows program (`.exe`)

> For the source code, click on the **"candlelight.py"** file inside the repository.

## Download

### Option 1: Download the repository
2. Click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**.  
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer. 

## Running the Program

- If you downloaded multiple files (default PyInstaller build):  
  1. Keep all the files in the same folder.  
  2. Double-click `candlelight.exe` in the `dir` folder, to run.   

> ⚠️ Windows may block `.exe` files downloaded from the internet. If it doesn't run:
